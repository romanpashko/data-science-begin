# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum all about Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, and an assignment. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

**Hearty thanks to our authors:** Jasmine Greenaway, Dmitry Soshnikov, Nitya Narasimhan, Jalen McGee, Jen Looper, Maud Levy, Tiffany Souterre, Christopher Harrison.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

> **Students**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo  complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz, then reading the lecture  completing the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends  go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-40229-cxa).

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned basic principles of data science, including ethical concepts, data preparation, different ways of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world use cases of data science, and more.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible  fun  can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small  become increasingly complex by the end of the 12 week cycle.

## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- Post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://red-water-0103e7a0f.azurestaticapps.net/), for 40 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.
