You could use `isnull` to do this in place, but that can be laborious, particularly if you have a lot of values to fill. Because this is such a common task in data science, pandas provides `fillna`, which returns a copy of the `Series` or `DataFrame` with the missing values replaced with one of your choosing. Let's create another example `Series` to see how this works in practice."
