# Working with Data: Non-Relational Data

Data can come from various sources, and is not limited to relational databases. This lesson focuses on non relational data and will cover spreadsheets and NoSQL.


## Spreadsheets

Many data scientists will not pick spreadsheets as their first tool for various and valid reasons. However, it's a popular way to store and explore data because it requires less work to setup and get started. In this lesson you'll learn the basic components of a spreadsheet, how to apply formulas and functions, generating charts and pivot tables, and how to sort and filter a spreadsheet. This lesson provides foundational knowledge of spreadsheets in the rare event that you find yourself working with with them. The examples will be illustrated with Microsoft Excel, but most of the parts and topics will have similar names and steps in comparison to other spreadsheet software.

A spreadsheet is a file and will be accessible in the file system of a computer, device, or cloud based file system. The software itself may be browser based or an application that must be installed on a computer or downloaded as an app. When it comes to Excel, these files are also defined as workbooks and this terminology will be used the remainder of this lesson.
